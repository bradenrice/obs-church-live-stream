1. Truth eternal, truth divine,

In thine ancient fulness shine!

Burst the fetters of the mind

From the millions of mankind!

2. Truth again restored to earth,

Opened with a prophet’s birth.

Priests of heaven’s royal line

Bear the keys of truth divine!

3. Truth shall triumph as the light

Chases far the misty night.

Endless ages own its sway,

Clad in everlasting day.
