1. Sweet is the peace the gospel brings

To seeking minds and true.

With light refulgent on its wings,

It clears the human view.

2. Its laws and precepts are divine

And show a Father’s care.

Transcendent love and mercy shine

In each injunction there.

3. Faithless tradition flees its pow’r,

And unbelief gives way.

The gloomy clouds, which used to low’r,

Submit to reason’s sway.
// end sheeet music
4. May we who know the sacred Name

From every sin depart.

Then will the Spirit’s constant flame

Preserve us pure in heart.

5. Ere long the tempter’s power will cease,

And sin no more annoy,

No wrangling sects disturb our peace,

Or mar our heartfelt joy.

6. That which we have in part received

Will be in part no more,

For he in whom we all believe

To us will all restore.

7. In patience, then, let us possess

Our souls till he appear.

On to our mark of calling press;

Redemption draweth near.
